# yelpBot

A Slack Bot for Yelp results

Search for something like 'Pizza near Hawaii' and yelpBot will suggest a restaurant!

## Initial Setup

- Setup a [Slack Outgoing Webhook](https://peloruslabs.slack.com/services/new)
- Save a copy of '.env-sample' as '.env' and replace the config variables with your Yelp and Slack credentials
- To test locally, run 'foreman start'

## Webhook Setup

- Set the "Trigger Word(s)" to "yelpbot"
- Set the "URL(s)" to wherever your node app is hosted, e.g. https://website.com/yelp
